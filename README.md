## Hi there, I'm Shivam :)

🚀  I have dedicated over seven years to the field of education and international development, with a particular focus on improving educational outcomes in low-resource settings.

📊  My expertise lies at the intersection of education research, program implementation and evaluation.

🌍  I have successfully led and contributed to large-scale education projects across India, Africa, USA, and the UK. 

💼  In my previous roles, I have designed assessment tools, developed structured pedagogy programs for foundational literacy and numeracy (FLN), and supported rigorous impact evaluations to inform policy and practice. 

🎓  As a Fulbright Masters Scholar, I earned my MA in Economics and Education from Teachers College, Columbia University, where I honed my skillset in data analysis, research methods, and policy evaluation.

❤️‍🔥  Passionate about evidence-based education reform, I strive to bridge the gap between research and practice — ensuring that data-driven insights translate into meaningful improvements in classrooms and communities worldwide.
